## Description
The Social Media API is a backend application that serves as the foundation for a social media platform. It provides endpoints and functionality to manage users, thoughts, and reactions, allowing users to post thoughts, interact with others, and perform various social media activities.

## Technologies Used
The application leverages the following technologies:
- Express
- Mongoose
- dotenv
- Javascript (and built in methods for date formating)
- node

## Installation
To run the Social Media API, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables, such as database connection details.
4. Create a local mongo database called mysocialDB
5. Seed user and thought data by running node (copy path to seed.js inside of utils)
6. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage
The API offers various features for social media interactions:
- Create and manage user profiles.
- Post and retrieve thoughts.
- React to thoughts with comments.
- Connect with friends by adding and removing friends.

To interact with the API, use tools like Postman or integrate it into your own frontend application.
